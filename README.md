Great course! Thanks for Prof. Ying and TA groups!

## Notion

1. Baseline model Graphormer: in the project, we choose to use Graphformer as the baseline. The code is shared [here](https://github.com/microsoft/Graphormer/)
2. Our refinement model SMoEformer: original code is built in `.ipynb` format. We implemented and tested it with the reference to HW4 Colab. The MoE classes and functions are coded in a correct way, therefore one can reproduce the results by sequetially run all the sections in the file.
