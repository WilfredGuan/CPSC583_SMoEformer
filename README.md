## ReadMe
This is a repo for the final project of CPSC 583 Deep Learning on Graph-structured Data, advised by Prof. Rex Ying.

Great course! Thanks for Prof. Ying and TA groups!

## Notion

1. Baseline model Graphormer: in the project, we choose to use Graphformer as the baseline. The code is shared [here](https://github.com/microsoft/Graphormer/)
2. Our refinement model SMoEformer: original code is built in `.ipynb` format, which may be hard to reproduce (hopefully one can make it just by running all of the cells sequentially). I will upload the original file in time and keep it unchanged, then try to make a split for potential examination.
